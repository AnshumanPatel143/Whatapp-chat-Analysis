Project Overview

The WhatsApp Chat Analysis project is a data-driven analytical system designed to extract structured insights from exported WhatsApp chat data. The project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization techniques to transform raw, unstructured chat logs into meaningful and actionable information.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from data ingestion to insight generation, and is aligned with industry-level practices in conversational data analysis.

Problem Statement

WhatsApp chats generate large volumes of unstructured textual data that are difficult to interpret manually. There is a need for an automated system that can process chat data efficiently and present insights related to user behavior, communication patterns, and sentiment trends.

Objectives

To analyze messaging activity and participation patterns

To identify temporal trends such as peak activity periods

To perform text-based analysis for understanding conversation themes

To evaluate sentiment distribution within conversations

To present insights using clear and interpretable visualizations

Key Functionalities

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Parsing raw chat files, handling timestamps, usernames, and removing noise using regular expressions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analysis of message frequency, active users, daily and monthly trends, and overall chat statistics.

Text Analytics
Tokenization, stop-word removal, word frequency analysis, and keyword extraction.

Sentiment Analysis
Classification of messages into positive, negative, and neutral categories using NLP techniques.

Visualization and Reporting
Generation of charts, word clouds, and dashboards for effective insight communication.
